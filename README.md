# Mask_please
This us May, 2020 whis would have special mention in the history due to Corona Virus (Covid-19). The world is under lockdown and till the time vaccine is discovered there is need to find out ways how people can resume work and not making mistakes which can let the Corona virus spread. Some of the key measures are wearing mask and maintaing physical (social) distancing.

This is a sample program to detect if a person is wearing mask or not, can be extended to detect physical distance too and raise an alarm in case of any violation.

Thanks to Adrian Rosebrock for providing the base application. Please refer below link to get the details

Somehow the application was not supporting to detect multiple faces while processing video feed and it is fixed here. Contributors can enhance this program to make it more useful to if anyone is not wearing mask or not maintaing physical (social) distancing in public areas or at shops or offices.

It can be plugged with CCTV video feed and some alarm system or can be standalone mobile app which can use camera phone. The possibilities are enormous like it can be also extended to process InfraRed Camera feeds to perform thermal screening and isolate people who might have fever symptom. 
So please go ahead and happy machine learning !
